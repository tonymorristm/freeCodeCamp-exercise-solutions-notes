We'll pass you an array of two numbers. Return the sum of those two numbers and all numbers between them.

The lowest number will not always come first.

Here are some helpful links:

Math.max()
Math.min()
Array.reduce()

It looks like the Array.reduce() function will reduce(sum) the numbers.
In order to sum the numbers, I need to determine what numbers are missing.

At this point, I'm not sure how Math.max/min will be used.
